# Project Description 
Background:  
Company XYZ is a wholesale distributor that serves a number of business clients (e.g., retailers, restaurants, hotels, or cafes) in Portugal. 
The management of XYZ would like to get a deeper understanding of the spending patterns of their clients, so that they can make strategic decisions to better meet the clients' demand (e.g., to improve inventory management and avoid shortages).

Question:  
1. Apply the appropriate data analytics technique(s) to understand client spending patterns. Specically, are there any meaningful client groups or types? If so, how are they
distributed across different channels or regions?
2. Based on your exploratory findings, provide some recommendations to XYZ's management that may help them in decision-making.

Resrources:  
Dataset contains 440 clients and their annual spending (in a standardized monetary unit). Each record corresponds to a client, and contains a client's region, channel, as well as the client's annual spending across 6 product categories.  
Dataset: [Wholesale customers data.csv](https://github.com/YenLing-Allison/Clustering_analysis_for_customer_segmentation/blob/8df230f5f9b0ec85906089c8c89e10cd7f4ad8d3/Wholesale%20customers%20data.csv)

Technical Document: [Clustering_analysis.R](https://github.com/YenLing-Allison/Clustering_analysis_for_customer_segmentation/blob/8df230f5f9b0ec85906089c8c89e10cd7f4ad8d3/Clustering_analysis.R)

In the project, the logic of my analyses is below:
A. Cleaning data  
B. Simple exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistic  
C. Calculate dataset distances  
D. Conduct clustering analysis  
E. Evaluate the quality of clustering
